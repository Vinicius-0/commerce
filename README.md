- Project 2 of HarvardX's CS50w. This project is a website that resembles an e-commerce auction platform like eBay, where users can navigate to various sections such as the Active Listings Page, utilize the Search feature, create a Listing, view a Listing Page, and access their Watchlist Page. The website is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQLite database, and the Python Django framework.
